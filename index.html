          Quarantine orders have forced couples to make a big decision, move in
          together for the first time. But because the quarantine is open ended,
          the indefinite, extra time together may cause a strain on
          relationships.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Although couples vary by age, location and profession- they share a
          similar desire to ride out this journey with their partner by their
          side. In only two weeks, a young couple based in Philadelphia has
          started a morning routine, for another, this experience is a trial run
          for living together long term. Psychologists chime in on why couples
          decide to quarantine together, and how to best manage inevitable
          problems that will arise.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “It’s such a scary time, it didn’t occur to us to quarantine alone,”
          said Sarah Faux, 33 and a successful painter. She has dated her
          boyfriend for a year and a half and as quarantine orders were about to
          hit New York City, Faux left her abode in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and
          moved in with her boyfriend in Woodside, Queens.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Faux and her boyfriend had talked about future plans to live together,
          and this quarantine has created a perfect opportunity for a test run.
          “It’s made me feel confident about living together,” she said.
          Ultimately, Faux is grateful to have her boyfriend during a time with
          so many unknowns. “We’re like each other’s lifeline right now.”
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Although Faux feels fortunate to have her boyfriend, she is aware that
          if this quarantine continues for months, they will have to incorporate
          alone time. “We’d have to kind of like build in to our routine
          together spending moments apart from each other within the apartment
          which is like a different thing to do cause usually we’re like getting
          a lot of alone time, we both live alone, and the when we see each
          other, we’re like hanging out,” she said.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          As you can see below, couples typically move for various other
          reasons. But the quarantine is an entirely new category adding to the
          list of reasons.

          Dr. Amelia Romanowsky, a clinical psychologist practicing in New
          Jersey, has been working with couples for 20 years. Romanowsky
          explained why couples choose to take a big step forward in their
          relationship during this stressful time. “We are hardwired to be
          attached and it's really important to have people around us,” she
          said. “Attachment is not just a need, it’s a drive it's like hunger or
          thirst. Without people around, a person will basically die
          psychologically.”
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          But Romanowsky also stressed it’s important not to rely on your
          partner to fulfill every need. “keep reaching out to your own
          networks, to reach out to your friends. Don't over isolate with a
          partner,” she said. “It's important to create quality time and work
          time. So setting those boundaries around, you know, what's what.”

          Bonnie Haggerty, 23, and her boyfriend moved in together after her
          roommates moved out. Both Haggerty and her boyfriend got laid off from
          their server jobs and have been living together for two weeks after
          four months of dating. Three days in, Haggerty suggested to
          incorporate alone time. “You definitely have to find alone time still,
          or separate or go to like different rooms of the house. I think that’s
          important,” she said.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Dr. J. Ryan Fuller, a clinical psychologist based in New York City,
          has worked with couples for 20 years, and has a background in anger
          research. Fuller said that the skills he teaches in anger management
          labs can be applied to couples that are now together 24/7. Fuller
          helps clients identify emotions before it escalates. Because couples
          don’t have the ability to leave the house or turn to friends, it’s
          critical that they are aware of their emotions. “it's important to try
          to prevent emotional problems before they become too intense,” he
          said.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Fuller also recommends taking a moment to step away before a fight, as
          it is ineffective to communicate when emotions run rampant. “I really
          stress with them being able to take a pause in the interaction with
          the, with the partner, and then go and regulate their own emotions,”
          he said.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Another technique Fuller recommends is to treat a problem with a
          partner like you would at work. In the workplace, you notice a problem
          and implement different solutions to solve that problem. This method
          can be applied to couples. “We have a tendency in our personal lives
          to sort of ignore tried and trusted techniques that we use in other
          areas of our life. So I encourage them to do the same thing in their
          personal lives,” he said.

          On the West Coast, another newish couple moved in together after
          dating for two and a half months. Kayla Peko, 23, is a nursing student
          and has been living with her boyfriend for two weeks. For Peko, this
          new situation has brought ups and downs. “I feel like I’m more
          insecure. Every day is the same, so we don’t necessarily have to kiss
          all the time,” she said. But this has also been an opportunity to get
          closer to her boyfriend’s six and seven-year-old kids. “With the
          quarantine, I’ve gotten closer to them which I think is a blessing,”
          she said. And by getting closer to her boyfriend’s children, Peko
          thinks it will make their relationship stronger.
